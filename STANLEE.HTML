                 Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber[1] /ˈliːbər/; December 28,
                 1922 – November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, 
                 editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the 
                 ranks of a family-run business called Timely Comics which later
                 became Marvel Comics. He was Marvel's primary creative leader
                 for two decades, expanding it from a small publishing
                 house division to a multimedia corporation that dominated the
                 comics and film industries.
